## Running the job

### Locally

Install the dependencies.

```
pipenv install --skip-lock
```

Run the job.

```
pipenv run python main.py
```

### Using Docker Compose:

```
docker-compose up --build
```

You can also use the command line instead of environment variables to specify which endpoints to run.
For a list of all command line arguments, run `docker-compose run app --help`.

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose run app --teachers --students --guardians
```

## Running tests

```
./run_tests
```

## Yearly maintenance

1. Confirm the org unit ID (used to get Student Usage) in the .env.
